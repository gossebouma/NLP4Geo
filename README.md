# NLP4Geo

Material for the NLP tutorial at the [Geo text mining workshop](https://ersa.org/events/geo-text-workshop/) organised by the University of Groningen


## Tutorial Outline 

1. NLP
1.1. working with Spacy to analyze the linguistic structure of a text
2. Named Entity Classification
3. Named Entitiy Linking and Geocoding
4. Information Extraction using linguistic patterns
5. Using a pretrained language model (ChatGPT)

## Prerequisites

In this tutorial we will be using Python as programming language, and Jupyter notebooks for the exercises and experiments. There are two ways you can work with Jupyter notebooks: either by ensuring that the software is installed on your laptop or by using Google 

### Installation of Python and Jupyter


### Using Google colaboratory

If you do not have access to a computer where you can install Python/Jupyter, you can also use [Google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), a cloud platform that supports working with Jupyter notebooks. The libraries mentioned below are available in colaboratory as well. 

(Uploading documents, linking with google drive)

## Libraries

1. Spacy (general purpose NLP toolkit) 
2. Spacy models: English, English trf (maybe), other (Dutch)
3. geocoder
